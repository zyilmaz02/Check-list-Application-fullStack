# Check-list-Application-fullStack
this is a fullStack application using Node.js, javaScript, HTML,CSS and MongoDB. (express FrameWork)

In order to make this application work you will need to create an account in MongoDB. which is free. 

After creating your MongoDB account you will need to link that acount to your program to store your data. 

it might seems so comlicated. I will try to simplify as much as I can later on.
